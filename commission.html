<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
<div class="padd10 fwhite stext">
If you want to buy a commission from me personally, there are a few terms you're going to need to know to remain on my good side! These are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Do not suggest an alternate method of payment--I will only accept payments through PayPal or Google Pay!
<li>Do not negotiate
<li>Do not lose your patience
<li>Do not be disrespectful--this includes practically yelling in ALL-CAPS
<li>Do not be offensive
<li>Do not write an essay on your commission--keep it brief!
<li>Do not skimp on references
<li>Do not expect anything regarding a timeframe
<li>Do not commission my character from another artist without permission 
</ol>
<br>
Failure to agree to these terms will result in the termination of your commission, and you will be blacklisted either until the next batch is open or indefinitely.
<br><br>
In short; respect my time and I will respect yours. Otherwise, we <i>will</i> have a problem.
<br><br>
Update! 12/08/19; Due to some unfortunate events that ocurred on 12/07/19, the community of any fetish that was part of the canceled commission prior to the breaking of my terms will also be punished until the offender apologizes. Failure to do so will keep that community blacklisted.
<br><br>
I didn't want to have to do this, but you know how the saying goes: "One bad apple spoils the bunch."

<h1>INTERESTED?</h1>
<div class="padd10 fwhite stext">
You can add me on Discord (MadMyke#1699) and DM me, or <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/thatanthrogamer/">visit my FA</a> or <a href="https://thatanthrocynic.deviantart.com/">visit my DA</a> and send me a note! In either case, we will work something out.
<br><br>
If you want to commission as 'Anonymous', please say "Make me anonymous." and I will make it so!
<br><br>
Once that's all done and the critera has been met, I will tell you to send money to my email through PayPal! And no, you do not need to make an account to do this, unless you feel inclined.
